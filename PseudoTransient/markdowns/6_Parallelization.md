# Code parallelization

# ðŸ’¾ Time to program ðŸ’¾

Parallelize your previous non-linear PT solver using either ParallelStenci.jl or KernelAnstractions.jl. Suggested steps:
1. Rewrite your kernels using standard Julia CPU functions
2. Check the code is still producing the same results
3. Modify the kernels to work with ParallelStenci.jl or KernelAnstractions.jl
